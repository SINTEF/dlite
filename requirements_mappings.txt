# oteexample.py in the mappings example also require OTEAPI (including oteapi-dlite).
# We don't include that requirement here, since it depends on the DLite-Python
# PyPI package, which can interfere with installation from source.
#
# If you uncomment the lines below and want to use DLite built from source, please
# `pip uninstall DLite-Python` before installing DLite from source.
