Some general utility functions
==============================
This directory contains the sources for a set of general utilities.
With a few exceptions, they are implemented in a .c source file with
an accompanied .h header file.  There are a few inter-dependencies
between the utilities, but no dependencies outside this directory
(except for the standard library).  All inter-dependencies are marked
in the list below.
