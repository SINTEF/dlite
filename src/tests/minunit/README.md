MinUnit
=======
Minunit is a minimal unit testing framework for C/C++ self-contained in a
single header file.

It provides a way to define and configure test suites and a few handy assertion
types.  It reports the summary of the number of tests run, number of assertions
and time elapsed.

Note that this project is based on:
http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html


How to use it
-------------
This is a minimal test suite written with minunit:

```c
#include "minunit.h"

MU_TEST(test_check) {
	mu_check(5 == 7);
}
MU_TEST_SUITE(test_suite) {
	MU_RUN_TEST(test_check);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	MU_RUN_SUITE(test_suite);
	MU_REPORT();
	return MU_EXIT_CODE;
}
```

Which will produce the following output:

```
F
test_check failed:
	readme_sample.c:4: 5 == 7


1 tests, 1 assertions, 1 failures

Finished in 0.00032524 seconds (real) 0.00017998 seconds (proc)
```

Check out `minunit_example.c` to see a complete example. Compile with something
like:

```
gcc minunit_example.c -lrt -lm -o minunit_example
```

Don't forget to add `-lrt` for the timer and `-lm` for linking the function `fabs`
used in `mu_assert_double_eq`.


Setup and teardown functions
----------------------------
One can define setup and teardown functions and configure the test suite to run
them by using the macro `MU_SUITE_CONFIGURE` with within a `MU_TEST_SUITE`
declaration.

```c
void setup()
{
  // do your setup here
}

void teardown()
{
  // do your teardown here
}

MU_TEST_SUITE(test_suite)
{
  MU_SUITE_CONFIGURE(setup, teardown);
  MU_RUN_TEST(...);  // run your tests here
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	MU_RUN_SUITE(test_suite);
	MU_REPORT();
	return MU_EXIT_CODE;
}
```


Assertions
----------
`mu_check(condition)`: Will pass if the condition is evaluated to
`true`, otherwise it will show the condition as the error message.

`mu_fail(message)`: Will fail and show the message.

`mu_assert(condition, message)`: Will pass if the condition is `true`,
otherwise it will show the failed condition and the message.

`mu_assert_int_eq(expected, result)`: Will pass if the two numbers are
equal or show their values as the error message.

`mu_assert_double_eq(expected, result)`: Will pass if the two values
are almost equal or show their values as the error message. The value
of `MINUNIT_EPSILON` sets the threshold to determine if the values are
close enough.

`mu_assert_float_eq(expected, result)`: Like `mu_assert_double_eq()`, but
expects that `expected` and `result` are floats instead.

`mu_assert_string_eq(expected, result)`: Will pass if the two strings are equal
or show their values as the error message.

`mu_assert_strn_eq(expected, result, size)`: Will pass if the first
`size` bytes of the two strings are equal or show their values as the
error message.

`mu_assert_ptr_eq(expected, result)`: Will pass if the two pointers are equal
or show their values as the error message.
