DLite Concepts
==============
DLite is a lightweight data-centric framework for semantic interoperability.

The core of DLite is a framework for formalised representation of data
described by data models (also called metadata or entities).
On top of this, DLite has a plugin system for various representations of
the data in different formats and storages, as well as bindings to popular
languages like Python, mappings to ontological concepts for enhanced
semantics and a set of tools.

DLite is a C implementation of the [SINTEF Open Framework and Tools
(SOFT)], which is a set of concepts and tools for using data
models to efficiently describe and work with scientific data.


The main components of DLite are shown in Figure 1, including bindings
to several programming languages, tools, the plugin framework for
storages, and mappings.

![DLite Architecture](../_static/architecture.svg)

_**Figure 1.** DLite Architecture._

DLite contains a core library, implementing a simple, but powerful
datamodel-based framework for semantic interoperability.
On top of this, it implements a set of bindings, storages, mappings
(using [tripper]) and tools.
The library also comes with a set of interfaces (API) to create
extensions and custom plugins.

DLite currently provides bindings with well-documented APIs to Python,
C and Fortran.
For C and Fortran it provides tools for code generation for easy and
efficient integration into simulation software.
The Python bindings are dynamic in nature and provide a simple way to
interact with semantic data from Python.

It also provides a plugin architecture for storages and mappings and
comes with a set of generic storages.
The plugins can be written either in C or Python and are available in any
of the bindings (including C and Fortran) due to the embedded Python
interpreter.

The main approach to developing software with DLite is to
incrementally describe the domain of the software using data models
(see below).
The data models can represent different elements of the software, and
be used in handling I/O as well as in code generation and
documentation.
Data models can also be used for annotating data and data sets.
This might be useful in cases where for instance the origin of the
data, license and ownership are of importance.

Since any complex software will have many data models and often multiple
instances of the same data model, DLite allows for creating collections of
data models with defined relationships.

An important idea is that software may be written is such way that
business logic is handled by the codebase, while I/O, file-formats,
version handling, data import/export and interoperability can be
handled by reusable components in the DLite-framework, thus reducing
risk and development time.


Datamodel hierarchy
-------------------

![Datamodel hierarchy](../_static/datamodel-hierarchy.svg)

_**Figure 2.** Datamodel hierarchy.
The instances colored orange are predefined, while the other may be defined by the user.
Data instances 5 and 6 are what we normally will call a collection._

Figure 2 shows the datamodel hierarchy implemented in DLite.
As a user, you will almost always deal with only data models or data
instances, but the hierarchy gives DLite a strong and theoretically
well-defined schema.

An *instance* in DLite is a formal representation of a dataset.  It is
called an instance, because it is an instance of a data model.
This is similar to instances of classes in object oriented programming.

In DLite we often say that an instance is described by its data model
(also called entity for historical reasons).
The DLite data models are themselves formalised and described by their metadata.
Hence, data models are instances, too.

Data models are instances of the *EntitySchema*.
The *EntitySchema* is an instance of the *BasicMetadataSchema*, which is an
instance of itself (meaning that it can be used to describe itself).
Hence, in DLite **everything is an instance**.  This has a practical
implication that the API for instances can be applied to all data models
as well.  Since the BasicMetadataSchema can describe itself, no more
abstraction levels are needed, making the DLite metadata schema
complete and well-defined.

From Figure 2, one can also see that *[collections]* are simply
instances of the *CollectionEntity*.

In DLite all instances that describe other instances (of a lower abstraction
level) are called *metadata*.

Compared to ontologies, *data instances* correspond to OWL individuals
while *data models* correspond to OWL classes.
OWL, which is based on first order logic, does not have concepts corresponding
to the higher abstraction levels of EntitySchema and BasicMetadataSchema.

A (so far unexplored possibility) with such a datamodel hierarchy is
that it can enable cross-platform semantic interoperability between
independent systems that describe their datamodel hierarchies using a
common BasicMetadataSchema.
Of course, this requires a common agreement on the BasicMetadataSchema.


### Data models
A data model contains information about the data that constitutes the
state of the object it describes.
The data model does not contain the actual data, but describes what the
different data fields are, in terms of name, data types, units,
dimensionality etc.
Information about data is often called metadata.
Formal metadata enables for the correct interpretation of a set of
data, which otherwise would be unreadable.

An example of a data model is 'Atom', which can be defined as something
that has a position, an atomic number (which characterizes the
chemical element), mass, charge, etc.
Another example of a completely different kind of data model can be a data
reference-data model with properties such as name, description, license,
access-url, media-type, format, etc. The first data model is suitable as
an object in a simulation code, while the latter is more suitable for
a data catalog distribution description (e.g. [dcat:Distribution]).
Data models allows for describing many aspects of the domain.
While each data model describes a single unit of information, a set of
data models can describe the complete domain.


#### Uniqueness & immutability
To ensure consistency, a data model (or metadata) should never be
changed once published.
They are uniquely identified by their *URI*, which has 3 separate
parts: a namespace, a version number and a name.
An data model named 'Particle' is unlikely to have the same meaning and
the set of parameters across all domains.
In particle physics, it would constitute matter and
radiation, while in other fields the term 'Particle' can be a general
term to describe a small inclusion or innoculant.
For this reason data models have namespaces, similar to how
vocabularies are defined in OWL.
The version number is a pragmatic solution to handle how properties of
a data model might evolve during the development process.
In order to handle different versions of a software, the data model
version number can be used to identify the necessary transformation
(instance mappings) between two versions of a data model.

For example, the URI for the EntitySchema is
http://onto-ns.com/meta/0.3/EntitySchema, with
`http://onto-ns.com/meta` being the namespace, `0.3` the version and
`EntitySchema` the name.
URIs do not have to be resolvable, but it is good practice that they
resolves to their definition.


Data model semantics
--------------------
![The datamodel of DLite.](../_static/datamodel.svg)

_**Figure 3**. The DLite data model._

The DLite data model is defined by the [Datamodel ontology] and shown
schematically in Figure 3.
In orange we have the same hierarchy as shown in Figure 2, with *instance*
as the most general concepts.

All data models and metadata have the following fields:
- *uri*: URI that uniquely identifies the data model.
- *uuid*: An UUID calculated as a hash of the *uri*. Used for database lookup.
- *meta*: The URI of the meta-metadata that this metadata is an instance of.
  If omitted, it defaults to the entity schema, which describes data models.
- *description*: A human description of the data model.
- *dimensions*: Common dimension used for array properties.
- *properties*: Descriptions of each of the underlying data properties.
- *relations*: A sequence of RDF subject-predicate-object triples with
  additional documentation.

Properties describe data in terms of keyword-value pairs, dimensions
enable efficient description of multi-dimensional arrays and relations
can describe anything that can be represented in a knowledge base.
Together they provide a general means to describe all types of data
that can be represented digitally.
Note however, that not all metadata uses all of these three ways to
describe their instances.
For example, data models have only dimensions and properties.
Also note that dimensions and properties cannot have the same name, since
they are accessed from the same namespace.


### Dimension
A metadata dimension simply provides a *name* and a human *description* of a
given dimension of an array property.


### Property
A property describes an element or item of an instance and has the following
attributes:
- *name*: a name identifying the property.
- *type*: the type of the described property, f.ex. an integer.
- *$ref*: formally a part of type.
  `$ref` is used together with the "ref" type, which is a special datatype for
  referring to other instances.
- *shape*: The dimensions of multi-dimensional properties.
  This is a list of dimension expressions referring to the dimensions defined above.
  For instance, if a data model have dimensions with names `H`, `K` and `L` and
  a property with shape `["K", "H+1"]`, the property of an instance of this data model
  with dimension values `H=2, K=2, L=6` will have shape `[2, 3]`.
- *unit*: The unit of the property.
- *description*: A human description of the property.

Please note that *dims* is a now deprecated alias for *shape*.


### Relation
A RDF subject-predicate-object triplet.
Relations are currently not explored in data models, but are included because of
their generality.
However, relations are heavily used in [collections].


### Identifiers
Instances are uniquely identified by a [universally unique identifier
(UUID)][UUID], which is a 128 bit label expressed as a string of the
form `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx`, where the `x`es are
hexadecimal digits in the range [0-9a-fA-F].

Since data models are a subclass of instances, as described above,
they are also uniquely identified by their UUID. The UUID of a data
model is calculated as a version 5 SHA1-based UUID hash of the data
model URI using the DNS namespace (with an optional final hash (#) or
slash (/) stripped off).

Furthermore, to allow identifiers to be used in triplestores, they can
also be normalised to (potentially) resolvable IRIs. The columns in
the table below list the three representations of identifiers. Any
representation can be considered an ID, while normalised IDs are valid
IRIs.

| ID             | Normalised ID  | Corresponding UUID    | Note                        |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| *uuid*         | *ns* / *uuid*  | *uuid*                |                             |
| *uri* / *uuid* | *uri* / *uuid* | *uuid*                |                             |
| *uri*          | *uri*          | hash of *uri*         |                             |
| *name*         | *ns* / *name*  | hash of *name*        | experimental, before v0.6.0 |
| *name*         | *ns* / *name*  | hash of *ns* / *name* | experimental, v0.6.0+       |
|                |                |                       |                             |

**Explanation of the symbols used in the table**

- *uuid* is a valid UUID. Ex: "0a46cacf-ce65-5b5b-a7d7-ad32deaed748"
- *ns* is the predefined namespace string: "http://onto-ns.com/data"
- *uri* is a valid URI with no query or fragment parts (as defined in
  the [RFC 3986] standard). Ex: "http://onto-ns.com/meta/0.1/MyDatamodel"
- *name* is a string that is neither a UUID or a URL. Ex: "aa6060".

```{note}
The support of name IDs is considered experimental!

The way a UUID is calculated from an ID of the form of a *name* was changed
in version 0.6.0.

The reason for this change is to ensure that the same UUID is obtained,
regardless of whether it is calculated from the *name* or its corresponding
normalised ID.

The behavior can be controlled with the `namespacedID` [behavior].
```

Any ID can uniquely be converted to a normalised ID and any normalised
ID can uniquely be converted to a UUID.  Most importantly, using a
normalised ID or UUID as an ID will result in the same corresponding UUID.

Going back is also possible. A UUID can be converted to a normalised
ID (ex: *uuid* -> *ns* / *uuid*) and a normalised `ID can be converted
to an ID (ex: *uri* -> *uri*). However, these conversions are not
unique.

The *id* form is convenient for human readable identifiers. But please
note, that such *id*'s must be globally unique. it is therefore
recommended to use normalised IDs instead. These are also valid IRIs
and can be used knowledge bases.

The tool `dlite-getuuid` can be used to manually convert URIs to their
corresponding UUIDs (or normalised IRI).
