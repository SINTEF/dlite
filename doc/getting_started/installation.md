Installing DLite
================
DLite is written C, but can be compiled with or without bindings to [Python] and [Fortran] and with or without support for [HDF5] and [librdf] storages.
A set of additional optional storages are available if compiled with Python support.
For a complete list, see [runtime dependencies].


Installing with pip
-------------------
If you are using Python, the easiest way to install DLite is with pip:

```shell
pip install DLite-Python[full]
```

The bracket `[full]` is optional, but ensures that you install DLite
together with all optional dependencies needed for additional features
and storage plugins. (see also [runtime dependencies]).


### Extra requirements
The complete list of extra requirements is as follows:

- [mappings]: Extra requirements needed for property mappings.
- [full]: All extra runtime requirements, needed by the various storage plugins or features like property mappings.
- [dev]: Extra requirements needed for development and testing.
- [doc]: Extra requirements needed for generating documentation.


### Supported binary releases
DLite uses [cibuildwheel] for providing binary releases for Linux and
Windows on various platforms and versions of Python.  The provided
wheels are shown in the following two tables.

Development installation
------------------------
If you to contribute or develop DLite, you should [build from source].

Python dependencies for development can be installed with

```shell
pip install DLite-Python[dev]
```

Install additional Python packages for building documentation with

```shell
pip install DLite-Python[doc]
```
