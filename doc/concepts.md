Concepts
========
dlite shares the [metadata model of SOFT][1] and generic data stored
with SOFT can be read with dlite and vice verse.  However, apart from
dlite being much smaller and less complete, there are also a few
notable differences in the API and even conceptual, which are detailed
below.


Named data instances
--------------------
In SOFT all Entity instances are referred to by their UUID.  However,
in some cases when you have unique and immutable data, e.g. default
input parameters to a given version of a software model, it may be
more convenient to refer to an unique human understandable name (URI),
like "mymodel-1.2.3_default_input", rather than a UUID on the form
"8290318f-258e-54e2-9838-bb187881f996".  dlite supports this.  The
tool `dlite-getuuid` can be used to manually convert URIs to their
corresponding UUIDs.

If the `id` provided to dlite_datamodel() or dlite_instance_create()
is not `NULL` or a valid UUID, it is interpreted as an unique uri
referring to the instance.  dlite will then generate a version 5
UUID from the `id` (from the SHA-1 hash of `id` and the DNS namespace)
that the instance will be stored under.  The original `id` will also be
stored and can be retrieved with dlite_datamodel_get_meta_uri().


Simple unified access to all data types
---------------------------------------
The datamodel API for accessing properties of an instance in SOFT, has
separate getters and setters for each type and number of dimensions.
dlite generalize and simplifies this by describing types and
dimensionality of properties with 4 parameters:

  - `type`: an enum defining the type of the data item (or items if
    it has dimensions), e.g. whether it is an integer, float or string...
    The table below summarises the implemented dtype's.
  - `size`: the size of a data item in bytes.
  - `ndims`: number of dimensions.  Scalars has ``ndims=0``.
  - `dims`: array of length `ndims` with the length of each dimension.

By taking these parameters as arguments, the functions
dlite_datamodel_get_property() and dlite_datamodel_set_property() can handle
all supported property types.  No storage strategy is needed.

The table below summarises the different dtypes defined in dlite.  For
more details, see dlite-type.h.  Also note that this supports arbitrary
dimensional arrays.  All arrays are assumed to be continuous in memory
in C-order.  dlite has currently no api for working with arrays as
pointers to pointers.

type      | dtype          | sizes                  | description                      | examples
----      | -----          | -----                  | -----------                      | --------
blob      | dliteBlob      | any                    | binary blob, sequence of bytes   | blob32, blob128, ...
bool      | dliteBool      | sizeof(bool)           | boolean                          | bool
int       | dliteInt       | 1, 2, 4, {8}           | signed integer                   | (int), int8, int16, int32, {int64}
uint      | dliteUInt      | 1, 2, 4, {8}           | unsigned integer                 | (uint), uint8, uint16, uint32, {uint64}
float     | dliteFloat     | 4, 8, {10, 12, 16}     | floating point                   | (float), (double), float32, float64, {float80, float96, float128}
fixstring | dliteFixString | any                    | fix-sized NUL-terminated string  | string20, string4000, ...
ref       | dliteRef       | sizeof(DLiteInstance*) | reference to another instance    | ref, http://onto-ns.com/meta/0.1/MyEntity
string    | dliteStringPtr | sizeof(char *)         | pointer to NUL-terminated string | string
relation  | dliteRelation  | sizeof(DLiteRelation)  | subject-predicate-object triplet | relation
dimension | dliteDimension | sizeof(DLiteDimension) | only intended for metadata       | dimension
property  | dliteProperty  | sizeof(DLiteProperty)  | only intended for metadata       | property

The examples shown in curly parenthesis may not be supported on all
platforms.  The size int, uint, float and double are
platform-dependent.  For portable applications you should to provide
the number of bits, like int32, uint32, float32, float64, etc...  Note
that the size specification of *blob* and *fixstring* are in bytes
(not bits) and that the terminating NUL-character __is__ included in the
specified size of the *fixstring* types.


Instances, entities, metadata, meta-metadata, etc...
----------------------------------------------------
A metadata structure following the concepts of SOFT and an API to work
with it, is implemented in dlite-entity.h / dlite-entity.c and shown
graphically in Figure 1.

![Metadata structure][fig1]

The actual data or *Data instances* are instances of the *Entity*
describing them.  *Entities* are instances of the *Entity schema*
which describes an *Entity*.  The *Entity schema* is an instance of
the *Basic metadata schema* describing it, which can describe itself
(and can be considered as an instance of itself).  Hence, **everything
is an instance**.  So in contrast to SOFT, *entities* in DLite are just
a special type of *metadata*.

*Collections* are a special type of instances containing references to
a set of set of instances and relationships between them.  They are
currently not yet implemented in dlite.

Instances can be subdivided into:

  - *Data instances* containing actual data.  These are serialised with a
    minimal header, only containing:
      - The UUID identifying the instance.
      - An optional reference to an URI uniquely identifying the instance.
        If given, the UUID is derived from it.
      - A reference (URI) to its metadata.

    This header is then followed by then followed by the content,
    i.e. the size of each dimension and the values of each property.

    A basic `DLiteInstance` type is defined that all data instances
    (including metadata) can be cast into.

    In the figure above, the *Data instances* and the *Collections* are
    both examples of *pure instances*.

  - Metadata.  Entities, Entity schema, Basic metadata schema, etc are
    all examples of metadata.  Metadata is typically identified by an
    URI of the form `namespace/version/name`.  When storing entities
    (as instances) an UUID will be derived from this URI.

    A basic `DLiteMetadata` type is defined, that all metadata can be
    cast into.  Since metadata also are instances, they header starts
    with the same header as DLiteInstance, but includes more fields
    needed to describe their instances.  Entities are a special case
    of metadata, whos instances are the actual data.

    All metadata is immutable.


Metadata semantics
------------------
The semantics used to by any type of metadata to describe its instances
contains three elements:

  - dimensions
  - properties
  - relations

The three first properties of all metadata schemas (metadata who's
instances are metadata) must be "dimensions", "properties" and
"relations" in this order.  However, it is possible to omit
"relations" if the metadata instance has no other properties.


Naming dimensions and properties
--------------------------------
The names of your dimensions and properties should be valid C identifiers,
not starting with underscore.  Another restriction is that should not be
one of the following keywords:

  - uuid
  - uri
  - meta
  - iri

Furthermore, while the following dimension and property names are
actively used in metadata, they must not be used in data instances:

  - ndimensions
  - nproperties
  - nrelations
  - dimensions
  - properties
  - relations
