Tips and Tricks
===============

Setting up a virtual Python environment for building dlite
----------------------------------------------------------
See the [Build and install to a virtual Python environment] in the installation instructions.


Debugging tests failing inside docker on GitHub
-----------------------------------------------
1. Set up a local virtual environment with the same version of Python as in the failing test.
   See [Build against Python environment].
2. Enter your virtual environment with dlite and install cibuildwheel.

        workon dlite
        pip install cibuildwheel

3. To list all manylinux images for Python 3.7, do

        cd dlite  # Root of DLite source directory
        CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE=ghcr.io/sintef/dlite-python-manylinux2014_x86_64:latest \
        CIBW_BUILD=cp37-manylinux_* \
        python -m cibuildwheel \
        --print-build-identifiers \
        --platform linux \
        python

   This should write

        cp37-manylinux_x86_64
        cp37-manylinux_i686

4. Run image.  For example, to run the image `cp37-manylinux_x86_64` do

        CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE=ghcr.io/sintef/dlite-python-manylinux2014_x86_64:latest \
        CIBW_BUILD=cp37-manylinux_x86* \
        python -m cibuildwheel \
        --output-dir wheelhouse \
        --platform linux \
        python

   which should run the tests and hopefully fail at the same place as on
   GitHub.  If that is the case, you can run the image again, but pause
   it before running the tests by prepending `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST=cat` to
   the previous command:

        CIBW_BEFORE_TEST=cat \
        CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE=ghcr.io/sintef/dlite-python-manylinux2014_x86_64:latest \
        CIBW_BUILD=cp37-manylinux_x86* \
        python -m cibuildwheel \
        --output-dir wheelhouse \
        --platform linux \
        python


5. Now you can list all active containers with

        docker ps

    the first container should have a name starting with `cibuildwheel-`.
    Copy its id and run

        ID=91312b22090f  # replace this id with the one listed by docker ps -a
        docker exec -it $ID /bin/sh

    This should start a new shell inside the container that the test was run it.


6. Activate the virtual environment that was used to build DLite

        source /tmp/tmp.*/venv/bin/activate

   and install final requirements manually

        cd /project/python/build
        pip install virtualenv -c /constraints.txt
        pip install --cache-dir /ci/pip_cache --prefer-binary -r /project/requirements.txt

7. Locate and install the DLite_Python wheel

        ls /tmp/cibuildwheel/repaired_wheel/DLite_Python-*.whl

        pip install /tmp/cibuildwheel/repaired_wheel/DLite_Python-0.3.18-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

8. Now we can run the Python tests with

        python /project/bindings/python/tests/test_python_bindings.py
