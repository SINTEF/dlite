Introduction
------------

A collection is defined as a set of entities and relationships between them. Collections are themselves defined as entities, and can this contain other collections as well. This is useful to represent the knowledge of the domain where data exists, in order to find data that relates to other data, but also to uniquely identify a complete data set with a single identifier.
