# A simple real world example for using dlite for chemical reaction and process

In this example the same dlite entities are used in different 

Dehydrogenation of ethane is considered:
C2H6(g) --> C2H4(g) + H2(g)

Energetics of the single gas phase molecules is calculated with an external
program (ASE). A data model for ASE is used.
