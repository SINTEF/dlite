    # The following is only for testing the Python package after build or install
    # on the build system in case you are developing on Windows.

    # Setting DLITE_USE_BUILD_ROOT="yes" will test in the build-directory
    # Otherwise we test in the install-directory

    # When building and testing the Python package via CTest, we set the PYTHONPATH to the
    # SWIG-generated package root in the build tree. in addition, shared libraries generated
    # during the build must be accessible.
    # For Linux, we take care of this by defining LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the test-environments.

    # For Windows, the approach depends on the Python which is being used

    # (a) For Anaconda Python on Windows, it is sufficient to add the dll directories to PATH
    #     before calling Python. _dlite.pyd can then find and load the dlls it depends on. We add
    #     the paths to the dlls generated during the build to the CTest environments PATH.

    # (b) For CPython, setting the PATH is not sufficient. This may be related to the
    #     following bug recognised by the numpy cummunity: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12667
    #     For CPython: To work around, call AddDllDirectory() directly via ctypes to set the
    #     search path on Windows.
    #
    #     To complicate things, this now does not work for Anaconda Python on Windows:
    #     https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/17051
    #     And: Using Anaconda Python as embedded Python on Windows has its own issues. We
    #     must in addition set the PYTHONHOME in the CTest environment:
    #     https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/2369
    #     https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/11374
